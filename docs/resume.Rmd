# Professional Summary
I am a geospatial scientist and ecologist seeking a research position in a dynamic and broad-thinking lab that allows me to pursue high-caliber science relevant to pressing human-environmental issues. My current research examines how global environmental change, including changed climate and fire cycles, alters ecosystem function and human vulnerability. Specifically, I lead cutting-edge research in wildfire ecology, with particular focus on quantifying, modeling, and predicting the consequences of human-started wildfires to the vulnerability of communities throughout the United States. I work at multiple scales, across disciplines, and with an international community of scientists.
