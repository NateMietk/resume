I am a geospatial scientist and ecologist seeking a research position in a dynamic and broad-thinking lab that allows me to pursue high-caliber science relevant to pressing human-environmental issues. My current research aims to examine how global environmental change, including changed climate and fire cycles, alters ecosystem function and human vulnerability.  I work at multiple scales, across disciplines, and with an international community of scientists. 

# Education
*Clark University*, **Ph.D**. Geography \hfill 2016 \
*Clark University*, **M.A.**, Geography, \hfill 2015 \
*Clark University*, **M.S.**, GIS for Development and Environment, \hfill 2013 \
*University of Maine, Orono, ME*, **B.S.**, Earth Science, \hfill 2009

# Current Employment
**Postdoctoral Research Fellow** \hfill 2016--present

*Earth Lab and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado at Boulder*

Leading cutting edge research in wildfire ecology, with particular focus on understanding the consequences of human-started wildfire in and around the wildland-urban interface (WUI). Some of my daily tasks include:

- -Deploying geospatial, reproducible workflows in a salable, cloud-compute environments via Amazon Web Services (AWS) via Docker Hub and GitHub to build stable, collaborative work environments across platforms
- -Writing clean, efficient code to download, process, and analyze big geospatial data ranging, but not limited to, satellite imagery, satellite derived products, governmental records, and climate time-series at local to national scales to answer landscape to continental scale questions
- -Building out and optimizing statistical models using a variety of techniques, including generalized linear mixed models, random forests, supervised and unsupervised classifications, neural networks, and other machine learning algorithms.
- -Mentoring/managing graduate level interns and research assistants.
